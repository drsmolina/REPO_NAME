Overview
This repository is a small TypeScript/React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
Its goal is to provide a client‑side weekly planner with half‑hour time blocks and optional templating. The app runs entirely in the browser and saves data via localStorage, so no backend services are required.

index.html – Serves the page and loads the TypeScript entry point

src/src/main.tsx – Bootstraps the React application and attaches it to the DOM

src/App.tsx – Implements the planner UI and all business logic

Day names, half‑hour time slots, and default week template

Local‐storage helpers and cell component definition

React hooks to load, persist, and manipulate planner data

Rendering a grid of days × times with editable cells and completion toggles

src/index.css – Tailwind CSS entry point and base styles

tailwind.config.js – Configures Tailwind to scan index.html and all .ts/.tsx files under src/

package.json – Defines scripts and dependencies (React, Tailwind, Vite, TypeScript)

src/.github/workflows/deploy.yml – GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the static site to GitHub Pages

Key concepts
Half‑hour time grid: The planner spans 05:00–23:30 in 30‑minute increments and covers seven days.

Base template & auto‑seed: A default week is defined and can auto‑populate new weeks.

Editable cells: Each time slot is content‑editable; clicking the checkmark toggles completion.

Local persistence: Planner data, template, and auto‑seed setting are stored in localStorage, so data survives page reloads.

Styling: Tailwind classes are used throughout; no additional CSS frameworks.

Deployment: A GitHub Actions workflow builds the project and publishes the dist/ folder to GitHub Pages.

Next steps for a newcomer
React fundamentals – Understand hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef) and JSX.

TypeScript with React – Learn how generics and type aliases (e.g., Cell, WeekData) improve type safety.

Tailwind CSS – Explore utility‑first styling and how Tailwind integrates with Vite.

LocalStorage patterns – Review how data is serialized, deserialized, and synced with component state.

Vite tooling – Try npm run dev for the dev server, npm run build for production, and examine the vite.config.ts base path setting.

Modularization – Consider splitting App.tsx into smaller components (e.g., planner grid, controls) as the project grows.

GitHub Pages deployment – Inspect the workflow to understand CI/CD and how static files are published.
